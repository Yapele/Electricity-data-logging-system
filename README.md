# Electricity-data-logging-system
This project contains 1 Arduino Uno file (Electricity)
You will need to include EmonLib.h and RTCLib.h in your Arduino IDE.

I also included a schematic (Schematic.bmp) but actual design was built on a vero-board (design.png).

Project is discussed on Steemit: https://steemit.com/technology/@mokluc/my-arduino-fun-projects-part1-electricity-data-logging-system
